NAME
    Test::Chimps::Client - Send smoke test results to a server

SYNOPSIS
    This module simplifies the process of sending smoke test results (in the
    form of "Test::TAP::Model"s) to a smoke server.

        use File::Temp;
        my $tmpfile = File::Temp->new( SUFFIX => ".tar.gz" );

        use TAP::Harness::Archive;
        chdir "some/module/directory";
        my $harness = TAP::Harness::Archive->new( {
            archive          => $tmpfile,
            extra_properties => {
                project   => 'my project',
                revision  => 'some revision',
                committer => 'me',
                osname    => $Config{osname},
                osvers    => $Config{osvers},
                archname  => $Config{archname},
            },
            ....
        } );
        $harness->runtests(glob('t/*.t'));

        use Test::Chimps::Client;
        my $client = Test::Chimps::Client->new(
            archive => $tmpfile,
            server  => "http://...",
        );

        print "Sending smoke report for $server\n";
        my ($status, $msg) = $client->send;
        die "Error: the server responded: $msg\n"
            unless $status;

DESCRIPTION
    Chimps is the Collaborative Heterogeneous Infinite Monkey
    Perfectionification Service. It is a framework for storing, viewing,
    generating, and uploading smoke reports.

    This distribution provides client-side modules and binaries for Chimps.

METHODS
  new ARGS
    Creates a new Client object. ARGS is a hash whose valid keys are:

    *   file

        Mandatory. The value must be a "Test::TAP::Model". These are the
        test results that will be submitted to the server.

    *   report_variables

        Optional. A hashref of report variables and values to send to the
        server.

    *   server

        Mandatory. The URI of the server script to upload the model to.

  send
    Submit the specified model to the server. This function's return value
    is a list, the first of which indicates success or failure, and the
    second of which is an error string.

ACCESSORS
    There are read-only accessors for model, report_variables, and server.
